CoHMM
=====

A Co-design proxy application for the Heterogeneous Multiscale Method
(HMM).

Original authors of the source code include the students of the 2013
[Los Alamos Co-Design Summer School](http://codesign.lanl.gov/summer-school). 
CoHMM is now maintained by ExMatEx: Exascale Co-Design Center for Materials
in Extreme Environments ([exmatex.org](http://exmatex.org)).


CoHMM augmented with spatial adaptive sampling
---------------------------------------------

The code can be found on the `sad` branch.

The source was used generate the data in the paper: 
B. Rouet-Leduc et al.,
*Spatial adaptive sampling in multiscale simulation*,
Comput. Phys. Commun. **185** (2014) 1857-1864
([link](http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cpc.2014.03.011)).

---------------------------------------------

The code can be found on the `red` branch.

CoHMM augmented with bold and distributed runtimes
---------------------------------------------

The code can be found on the `bad` branch.
